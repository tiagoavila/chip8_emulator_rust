# CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust

This project is a CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter written in Rust. CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language, originally developed in the 1970s, commonly used to teach emulation and low-level programming concepts.

> **Inspired by**: This project was motivated by [Austin Henley's "Challenging projects every programmer should try"](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html), which highlights text editor implementation as one of the most educational programming projects. Building a text editor from scratch teaches fundamental concepts about data structures, cursor behavior, and efficient text manipulation that every programmer should understand.

## Features
- Accurate CHIP-8 instruction set implementation
- Loads and runs CHIP-8 ROMs (see `files/roms/` for examples)
- Rust-based for performance and safety
- Simple graphics and input handling


## How to Run
**Ensure you have Rust installed.**

### Run the Emulator (Normal Mode)
```sh
cargo run
```

#### Select a ROM from the menu:

### Run the Emulator (Debug Mode)
```sh
argo run -- --debug --instruction_count 50 --rom PONG
```

### File/Folder Explanations
- **chip8_core/**: Contains the reusable core emulation logic as a library crate.
- **src/**: Main application code, including the emulator entry point and modules for graphics, input, and menus.
- **files/roms/**: Example CHIP-8 ROMs you can run with the emulator.
- **files/images/**: Images used in documentation or the emulator UI.
- **target/**: Build artifacts and compiled binaries (auto-generated).

## ROMs
Sample CHIP-8 ROMs are included in the `files/roms/` directory. You can find more online or create your own.
